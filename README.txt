PROJECT 3 Catalog App - Version 1 - July 2015
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


PROJECT DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Description:

"Lisa's Grocery Store" is a web application that provides a list of products 
within a variety of product categories. It integrates user registration and 
authentication via Google or Facebook. Authenticated users have the ability to 
post, edit, or delete their own products.

Additional Functionality:
- API Endpoints: Apart from the required JSON endpoints, the app has also an 
                 implementation of XML and Atom endpoints.
- CRUD: Read:    A product image field is added which can be read from the 
                 database and displayed on the page.
- CRUD: Create:  A product image field can be included when a new product is 
                 created in the database.
- CRUD: Update:  For already existing products product images can be added, 
                 changed and deleted.
- CRUD: Delete:  The function is implemented using POST requests and nonces to
                 prevent cross-site request forgeries (CSRF).
- Comments:      Comments are (hopefully ;-)) thorough and concise. XXX Pycco? XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
